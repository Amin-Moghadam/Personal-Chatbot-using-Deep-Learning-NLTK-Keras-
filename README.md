# 🤖 Personal Chatbot using Deep Learning and NLTK

This project builds a simple but functional personal chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning with Keras, and a GUI built with Tkinter.

## 📚 How It Works
- Trained on custom `intents.json` file that defines conversation patterns and responses
- Uses a Bag-of-Words model and an LSTM-based neural network
- Loads trained model from `chatbot_model.h5`
- GUI implemented with Tkinter for interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Tkinter (GUI)
- JSON, Pickle

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install nltk keras tensorflow numpy
